# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, machine learning systems improve their performance through experience.

## Key Concepts

Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data, known as "training data," to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. The goal is to enable computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance.

## Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error

Machine learning has applications in many fields including computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
