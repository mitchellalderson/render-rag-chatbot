# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.

## Core Tasks

NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks:

- **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined groups
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying and classifying named entities in text
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone of text
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another
- **Question Answering**: Automatically answering questions posed in natural language
- **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries of longer documents

## Modern Approaches

Traditional NLP relied heavily on rule-based systems and statistical methods. Modern NLP has been transformed by deep learning, particularly with the introduction of:

- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Recurrent neural networks (LSTMs, GRUs)
- Attention mechanisms
- Transformer models (BERT, GPT, T5)

## Challenges

NLP faces several inherent challenges due to the complexity and ambiguity of human language:

- Dealing with context and multiple meanings
- Understanding sarcasm and figurative language
- Handling different languages and dialects
- Managing domain-specific terminology
- Addressing bias in training data
