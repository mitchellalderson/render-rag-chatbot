# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. It uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.

## Neural Network Architecture

Deep learning models consist of multiple layers of processing units (neurons) arranged in a hierarchical structure. Each layer transforms its input into a more abstract representation. The "deep" in deep learning refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed.

## Common Architectures

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Primarily used for image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Designed for sequential data
- **Transformers**: The architecture behind modern large language models
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Used for generating new data

## Applications

Deep learning has revolutionized many fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, drug discovery, and game playing. Notable achievements include beating human champions at Go and chess, and generating realistic images and text.

## Training Challenges

Training deep neural networks requires large amounts of data and computational resources. Common challenges include overfitting, vanishing gradients, and the need for careful hyperparameter tuning.
