# Computer Vision

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. It seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.

## Fundamental Tasks

Computer vision encompasses several key tasks:

- **Image Classification**: Assigning labels to entire images
- **Object Detection**: Locating and classifying multiple objects within an image
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Classifying each pixel in an image
- **Instance Segmentation**: Identifying individual objects and their boundaries
- **Image Generation**: Creating new images from scratch or modifying existing ones
- **Face Recognition**: Identifying individuals from facial features

## Technologies and Techniques

Modern computer vision heavily relies on deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Key architectures include:

- ResNet: Uses residual connections for very deep networks
- YOLO (You Only Look Once): Real-time object detection
- Mask R-CNN: Instance segmentation
- Vision Transformers: Applying transformer architecture to images

## Real-World Applications

Computer vision is used in numerous practical applications:

- Autonomous vehicles for navigation and obstacle detection
- Medical imaging for disease diagnosis
- Facial recognition for security systems
- Quality control in manufacturing
- Augmented reality applications
- Sports analytics and player tracking
